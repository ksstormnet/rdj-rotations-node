# Implementation Sequence:

## Foundation Layer - RuleManager
- First implement RuleManager as the foundation since all other components depend on it
- It loads and validates schedule-rules.json
- Provides typed access to rules
- Establishes error handling patterns  
This gives us confidence in rule access and validation

## Pattern Management - PatternManager
- Builds on RuleManager to define valid patterns
- Implements both music set and commercial break patterns
- Validates pattern combinations
- Handles pattern-specific rules  
This gives us our building blocks for rotations

## Rule Enforcement - ValidationManager
- Uses both RuleManager and PatternManager
- Implements comprehensive rule checking
- Handles category frequencies and placement rules
- Validates pattern compliance  
This ensures we can verify rotation validity

## Analysis Layer - ScheduleAnalyzer
- Builds on all previous components
- Provides detailed analysis of violations
- Identifies rule conflicts
- Suggests resolutions  
This gives us the ability to understand problems

## Construction Layer - RotationBuilder
- Uses all previous components
- Implements systematic building process
- Handles constraint satisfaction
- Provides modification capabilities  
This gives us the ability to create valid rotations
